            <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
            <p>
                I am a twenty-year-old college student that was successfully granted a scholarship by the CareerUPrime program in Children International. I'm a supportive, positive individual that's open to many different perspectives. In addition to being a sociable person, I have a large number of friends in real life and virtually, as well as at school and at home, particularly with my family.

            <h3>MY TALENTS</h3>
            <p>
                I have four talents. My first is drawing, which I learned from an older friend when I was younger. My second is singing, which I learned how to perform from my sister. She also taught me how to control my voice, which helped me produce an excellent tone. My third talent is cooking, which I am passionate about, it makes me happy to see people smile because of my foods. Lastly, I love dancing, which makes me feel confident and happy.
